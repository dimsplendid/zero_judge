My solution log and explanation of [Zero Judge](https://zerojudge.tw/)

Iâ€™ll start by tackling it in Python, and then possibly move on to JavaScript and Rust.

## Python

Although I intend to use the latest version (3.13 currently), the system is still running version 3.6.9. This may affect the functionality of repository solutions on the website, as they might not run as expected. I plan to test everything to confirm compatibility, but please feel free to raise any additional issues in the meantime.

### Install

```bash
conda create python=3.13 -n zero_judge
conda activate zero_judge
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Instrument

#TODO: To confirm how do I actually do :D
I use jupyter lab for better interaction and demonstration, change the `alt_input` function to `input` in the website for test
